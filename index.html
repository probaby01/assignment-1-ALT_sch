        <h2>why i joined the AltSchool Engineering program</h2>
        <p>I've always been fascinated by technology, and the idea of building something from scratch has always excited me. While my current work as a plumber is fulfilling in its own way, it doesn't ignite the same spark of passion that I find in coding. I'm driven to transition into a career where I can combine my love for technology with my desire to create meaningful solutions. The AltSchool Engineering program presents the perfect opportunity for me to do just that.

            The program's focus on practical skills and hands-on learning aligns perfectly with my desire to quickly gain the knowledge and experience needed to succeed as a software engineer. I'm eager to learn from experienced mentors and collaborate with like-minded individuals, all while developing the skills that will allow me to contribute to the tech world. I believe that the AltSchool Engineering program will provide me with the foundation I need to achieve my dream of becoming a software engineer and making a real impact in the tech industry.</p>
